# a = 24

# c = 25

# d = int(b)
# print (d)

print ("Hello World, I am Here")

# name = input("Enter your name: ")
# age = input("Enter your age: ")
# city = input("Enter your city: ")
# print (name, age, city)
# print (("My name is")(name), ("I am")(age)("years old"), ("And I live in")(city)), <wrong>
# print("My name is", name, "I am", age, "years old", "And I live in", city) Correct
# There are other below Alternative solutions 
# print("My name is " + name + " I am " + age + " years old " + "And I live in " + city)  using operator Correct
# one more way below
# print(f"My name is {name} I am {age} years old And I live in {city}")  using f-string Correct
# one more way below
# print("My name is {} I am {} years old And I live in {}".format(name, age, city)) using .format (dot format method) method Correct

# a = input ("Enter a value for a:")
# b = input ("enter the value for B") 

# print ("Sum", (a+b)) this is wrong because a and b are automatically pre declared string as we haven't declared it earlier in any way wrong
# print ("Sum", int(a+b)) this statement will work but it will show string type answer as string "a" + string "b". Partially correct
# print ("Sum", (int(a)+int(b))) correct

# print (("Difference"),(int(a)-int(b)))
# print (("Product"),(int(a)*int(b)))
# print (("division"),(int(a)/int(b)))

# Print Statements

# print ("How are you \n are you all right") "\n" is only for the new line in ouput but not in the code/syntax Correct 
# print ("""How are you
#         are you all right""")
#         output
# How are you
#        are you all right

# print ("""How are you \n
#         are you all right""") here it will add one more line to the statement. correct

#     output 
# How are you 

#         are you all right


# print("we are learning Python\n we will \ complete it") The output will be there but only witha a warming 
#     output
#     we are learning Python
#  we will \ complete it

# print("we are learning Python\n we will \\ complete it") double slash "\\" will nugget the consideration of "\" as a part of code but only make it as a part of printing statement Correct
#     output 
#     we are learning Python
#     we will \ complete it
